The purpose of this part is to use code to automatically fetch data from alameda offical website.


* Usage:
Please change the filepath in the alameda_run.py file into your local address.
The url is just for the alameda offical website

Once alameda_run.py and alameda_utils files are downloaded, please run the following:

```
python3 alameda_run.py
```

When everything is ready, and please ensure that the py file can run normally, please check the file address you set in the function to find the result of the operation and all the output is in CSV format.
 
 * For operator: The orders of columns are matched with those in the datasets and the web structures are different for each county. 
 You just need to copy the data in the csv to put them in the original dataset.

If you have any questions please contact info@covidincustody.org.
