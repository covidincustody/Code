Please change the address in the sf_run.py file into your local address
The url is just for the san francisco offical website

Once sf_run.py and sf_utils files are downloaded, please run the following:

python3 run.py

When everything is ready, and please ensure that the py file can run normally, please check the file address you set in the function to find the result of the operation and all the output is in CSV format.
 
 * For operator: The orders of columns are matched with those in the datasets and the web structures are different for each county. 
 You just need to copy the data in the csv to put them in the original dataset.
