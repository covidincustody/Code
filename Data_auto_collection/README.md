### About the Project

The purpose of this part of the project is to use code to automatically fetch data from different counties offical website.


### Usage
Some of the counties have installation required. So before runing the data please check the common in the py file and follow the installation steps carefully. Data from all sources will be pulled directly from the webpage, and an output csv and the final data set will be stored in the same directory as utils.py and run.py. Once both code files are downloaded, please run the following:

python3 run.py

When everything is ready, and please ensure that the py file can run normally, please check the file address you set in the function to find the result of the operation and all the output is in CSV format.

In each utils.py file for differnt county this is the place you need to change to your personal local saving address.

 * For operator: The orders of columns are matched with those in the datasets and the web structures are different for each county. 
 You just need to copy the data in the csv to put them in the original dataset.

If you have any questions please contact info@covidincustody.org.
