### About the Project

The purpose of this part of the project is to use code to automatically fetch data from different counties offical website.


### Usage
There are installation required. Data from all sources will be pulled directly from the webpage, and an output csv (general_population.csv) will be stored in the same directory as utils.py and run.py. Once both code files are downloaded, please run the following:

python3 run.py

If you want to this par tof code to extract the corresponding region data, you only need to download the original code locally and upload it to the local Python software. For example, VS code or Jupyter Notebook. Then download additional software or python packages according to the instructions of each py file. When everything is ready, and to ensure that the py file can run normally, please check the file address you set in the function to find the result of the operation and all the output is in CSV format.

In each py file this is the place you need to change to your personal local saving address.
