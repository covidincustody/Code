### instruction on how to use web scripter

If you want to use the py file in web-scrapers to extract the corresponding region data, you only need to download the original code locally and upload it to the local Python software. For example, VS code or Jupyter Notebook. Then download additional software or python packages according to the instructions of each py file. When everything is ready, and to ensure that the py file can run normally, please check the file address you set in the function to find the result of the operation.
